# 50.039 Big Project: Stocks Return Prediction

Our objective is to use Deep Learning techniques in order to generate enough predictive power, so that a trading strategy might be developed that leverages the model outputs in order to generate a profit. Training a model to predict certain aspects of the stock price is equivalent to statistical arbitrage - the methodology of identifying patterns in the stock price which can predict future movements in the stock price, purely based on technical patterns. The term ‘arbitrage’ means a risk free profit.
